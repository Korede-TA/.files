# Dot Files

Contains my personal development environment configuration files. I use the
[Dot framework](https://github.com/sds/dot) for managing the plugins.

## Installation

I highly recommend you curate your own configuration using the Dot framework,
but if you'd like a jump start with a working configuration you can simply
run the following in your terminal:

```bash
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sds/.files/master/libexec/install)"
```

Restart your terminal to have the changes take effect.
